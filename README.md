# hiring-web
this is prototype for hiring web-app for company who want to recruit talent effectively

## Project Overview
This project is a modern job hiring platform built with Next.js 16 and Supabase, featuring an AI-powered gesture capture system using MediaPipe Tasks Vision.

The platform allows administrators to manage job postings, while applicants can apply directly through a dynamic form that automatically adjusts per job configuration.
Additionally, the system uses real-time hand gesture recognition â€” candidates can take a photo automatically by showing 3 fingers, enhancing user interaction and ensuring a live applicant presence.

## Key Features
- Dynamic job listings with CRUD operations via Supabase.
- page for each job detail, loaded dynamically by slug.
- Auto-generated forms based on database configuration (job_configs).
- Automatic webcam photo capture triggered by hand gesture detection.
- Clean and responsive UI with TailwindCSS integration.
- Secure API routes.
